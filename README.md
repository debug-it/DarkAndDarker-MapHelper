# DarkAndDarker-MapHelper

### Fork of https://github.com/NickJordan289/DarkAndDarker-MapHelper/blob/main/record.py
### Major credits to NickJordan289.
### Unfinshed dark and darker map helper using open cv and json locations.

### Whats changed:
```
  This was made for a 1440 display, you will have to change size/cropping for a different display.
  After starting the program, it will locate and find the correct crypt map.
  Loop through all json actors and plot them on map (default are Golden Chest's, Health Shines, and Static Escapes)
  Click on the map to plot your own point
```

### Notes:
```
  Very rarely, it will select the wrong map, simply restart
```

### Spellsandguns map vs opencv map
